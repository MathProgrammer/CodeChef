Pooja would like to withdraw X $US from an ATM. 
The cash machine will only accept the transaction if X is a multiple of 5, and Pooja's account balance has enough cash to perform the withdrawal transaction 
(including bank charges). 
For each successful withdrawal the bank charges 0.50 $US. Calculate Pooja's account balance after an attempted transaction.

if(withdrawal + 0.5 <= balance && withdrawal%5 == 0)
        balance -= (withdrawal + 0.5);
