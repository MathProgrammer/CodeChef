Yesterday, puppy Tuzik learned a magically efficient method to find the sum of the integers from 1 to N. He denotes it as sum(N). 
But today, as a true explorer, he defined his own new function: sum(D, N), which means the operation sum applied D times: the first time to N,
 and each subsequent time to the result of the previous operation.

For example, if D = 2 and N = 3, then sum(2, 3) equals to sum(sum(3)) = sum(1 + 2 + 3) = sum(6) = 21.

Tuzik wants to calculate some values of the sum(D, N) function. Will you help him with that?

Input
The first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. Each test case is described by a single line containing two integers D and N.

Output
For each testcase, output one integer on a separate line.
