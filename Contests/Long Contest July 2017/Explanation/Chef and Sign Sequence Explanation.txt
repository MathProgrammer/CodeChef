Chef found a strange string yesterday - a string of signs s, where each sign is either a '<', '=' or a '>'. Let N be the length of this string. 
Chef wants to insert N + 1 positive integers into this sequence and make it valid. 
A valid sequence is a sequence where every sign is preceded and followed by an integer, and the signs are correct. 
That is, if a sign '<' is preceded by the integer a and followed by an integer b, then a should be less than b. Likewise for the other two signs as well. 
Chef can take some positive integers in the range [1, P] and use a number in the range as many times as he wants.
Help Chef find the minimum possible P with which he can create a valid sequence.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Notice that if there was a sequence of equal to and greater than signs like,

< = < = = < ... The number of distinct numbers must be equal to at least 1 more than the number of < signs. Because each of these signs cause an inequality.

----------------------------------------

My idea was to go through the string ... Go through every run of < and =, and > and =, keeping track of the maximum number of < and > occuring in any run.

P = 1 + max.

I got a WA at first because I only considered the greater case and didn't consider that case of > and = signs. Fortunately, I was able to catch the mistake myself.
I solved it in contest environment so no access to other solutions or editorials. It felt great to see the green tick after solving a problem on your own !

Also got strange results when the second loop was starting from i... The second loop always starts from where the first one ends.
We know the entire extent of the first loop has no < signs. This ensures that the complexity is linear.

void solve()
{
    char sequence[MAX_LENGTH];
    scanf("%s", sequence);

    int maximum_sign_run = 0, length = strlen(sequence), i, j;

    for(i = 0; i < length; i = j)
    {
        int no_of_greater_than = 0;
        for(j = i; sequence[j] == '<' || sequence[j] == '='; j++)
        {
            no_of_greater_than += (sequence[j] == '<');
        }

        int no_of_less_than = 0;
        for(; sequence[j] == '>' || sequence[j] == '='; j++) //Pick off from where the previous loop ended.
        {
            no_of_less_than += (sequence[j] == '>');
        }

        maximum_sign_run = max(maximum_sign_run, max(no_of_greater_than, no_of_less_than));

    }
    printf("%d\n", maximum_sign_run + 1);

}
