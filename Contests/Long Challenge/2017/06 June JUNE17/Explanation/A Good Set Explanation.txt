A set of integers is called good if there does not exist three distinct elements a, b, c in it such that a + b = c.

Your task is simple. Just output any good set of n integers. All the elements in this set should be distinct and should lie between 1 and 500, both inclusive.

The sum of two odd numbers is even. Odd numbers are not closed with respect to addition.

    for(i = 1; i <= size_of_set; i++)
    {
        printf("%d ", (2*i - 1));
    }
    printf("\n");
