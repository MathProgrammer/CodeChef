Instead of dealing with decimals, deal with integers so multiply it by 100. 
Round the speed after multiplying by 100

void solve()
{
    double k1, k2, k3, v;
    cin >> k1 >> k2 >> k3 >> v;

    const int DISTANCE = 100,RECORD = 958;

    double speed = k1*k2*k3*v;
    int time = round(100*DISTANCE/speed);

    cout << (time < RECORD ? "Yes" : "No") << "\n";
}
