Chef lives in a big apartment in Chefland. The apartment charges maintenance fees that he is supposed to pay monthly on time. 
But Chef is a lazy person and sometimes misses the deadlines. The apartment charges 1000 Rs per month as maintenance fees. 
Also, they also charge a one-time fine of 100 Rs for each of the late payments. It does not matter how late the payment is done, the fine is fixed to be Rs.100.

Chef has been living in the apartment for N months. Now, he wants to switch the apartment, so he has to pay the entire dues to the apartment. 
The deadline for the N-th month is also over. From his bank statement, he finds the information whether he paid apartment rent for a particular month for not. 
You are given this information by an array A of size N, where Ai (can be either 0 or 1) specifies whether he has paid the 1000Rs in the i-th month or not. 
Assume that Chef paid the fees in the i-th month, then this fees will be considered for the earliest month for which Chef has not yet paid the fees.

For example, assume Chef did not pay any money in first month and 1000Rs in the second month. Then this rent of 1000Rs will be considered for 1st month. 
But this counts as late payment for the first month's fees, and hence he will have to pay Rs. 100 for that. 
And since the payment he made in the second month is not accounted for the second month, but rather for the first month, 
he will incur a fine of Rs.100 even for the second month.

He has not paid any of the fines so far. Can you please help in finding Chef total due (all the fines, plus all the unpaid maintenance fees) that he has to pay to apartment?

After the first month is missed, all months are late. So, keep track of the first zero and the number of zeroes.

    const int fine = 100, maintenance = 1000;
    int number_of_months, i, number_of_unpaid_months = 0, due, paid, number_of_late_months = 0;
    scanf("%d", &number_of_months);

    for(i = 1; i <= number_of_months; i++)
    {
        scanf("%d", &paid);

        if(paid == 0)
        {
            number_of_unpaid_months++;
            if(number_of_late_months == 0)
            {
                number_of_late_months = (number_of_months - i + 1);//After the first month that is missed, every month is late
            }
        }
    }

    due = number_of_unpaid_months*maintenance + number_of_late_months*fine;
