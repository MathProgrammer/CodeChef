You are given a string. Your task is to determine whether number of occurrences of some character in the string is equal to the sum of the 
numbers of occurrences of other characters in the string. 

-------------------------------------------------

In other words, check if frequency(c) = length/2, for any c in the array


To be more precise, 2*frequency(c) = length, because if there are 2n+1 characters and 1 occurs n times, it does not satisfy the statement. 

char string[MAX_LENGTH], frequency[NO_OF_ALPHABETS] = {0};
    int max_frequency = 0, i, length;

    scanf("%s", string);

    for(i = 0; string[i] != '\0'; i++)
        frequency[string[i] - 'a']++;

    length = i;

    for(i = 0; i < NO_OF_ALPHABETS; i++)
        max_frequency = max(max_frequency, frequency[i]);



    printf("%s\n", (2*max_frequency == length ? "YES" : "NO") );
