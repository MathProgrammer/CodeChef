Each bit is set in at most 1 integer. 

Let us use simple Mathematics to count the number of ways to distribute b bits into 3 sets 

1. 3^b 
2. There are 3 x 2^b ways in which one of the two integers are empty 
3. There are 3 ways to distribute in which two of the three integers are empty 

Answer = 3^b - 3 x 2^b + 3

    long long n;
    cin >> n;
    
    int bit_count = no_of_ones(n);
    
    const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
    long long all_three = power(3, bit_count, MOD);
    long long only_two = (3*power(2, bit_count, MOD))%MOD;
    long long only_one = 3;
    
    long long answer = all_three - only_two + only_one + MOD;
    answer %= MOD;
    
    cout << answer << "\n";
