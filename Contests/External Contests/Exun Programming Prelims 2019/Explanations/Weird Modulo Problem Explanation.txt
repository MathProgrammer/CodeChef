If x < y, then it is always optimal to use x (mod y) instead of y (mod x)

The reason is that x (mod y) is x and y (mod x) is at most x

In order to have the highest possible value, we need to sort the integers in ascending order and evaluate the expression one by one. 

The answer will be the smallest integer in the array. 

The uniqueness constraint is very important in this problem.
